# GFRN_signatures
This repository presents analysis done for the paper "Genomic signature networks identify unique growth phenotypes and predict drug response in breast cancer patients." 

# Datasets
You will need to have the following datasets for running the analyses:
1. ICBP breast cancer cell line  gene expression dataset: icbp_Rsubread_tpmlog.txt
2. ICBP breast cancer cell line drug response dataset: ICBP_drugs.txt 
3. TCGA brest cancer tumor gene expression dataset
4. TCGA "normal" adjacent breast cancer gene expression dataset
5. TCGA PAM50 classification of tumor samples
6. TCGA clinical dataset 
7. ICBP cell line single pathway optimized prediction
8. ICBP cell line multi-pathway optimized prediction
9. TCGA cell line single pathway optimized prediction
10. TCGA cell line multi-pathway optimized prediction
11. Drug response assay
